### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Apoorv 

#### About me

I have a passion for helping organizations make evidence-driven decisions and sharing their insights with new audiences. With a strong background in data gathering and preparation, as well as advanced analytical skills including proficiency in statistical and algebraic techniques, I'm able to create machine learning models that can be deployed on a server. I'm also a certified programmer, which enables me to develop and deploy technology-driven solutions.

One thing that sets me apart is my ability to work with both technical and non-technical personnel, making data accessible and useful for all. I believe that technology can be used to deliver public services that are in tune with the aspirations of billions of people, and to democratize access to technology.

I'm committed to using my skills to support organizations in making evidence-driven decisions and driving growth. I'm an excellent collaborator with a commitment to excellence and an eye for detail. Whether it's analyzing data or presenting insights in a meaningful way, I'm confident in my ability to help organizations unlock the power of their data and achieve success.
